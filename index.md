I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich since November 2021, working at the Automatic Control Laboratory with [Prof. Florian Dörfler](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/index.html). I received my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Hua Geng](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1094/1517.htm), and my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2016. My research interests include stability issues of future power systems, in particular in modeling, stability analysis, and control of renewable energy resources. I was a recipient of the Beijing Outstanding Graduates Award and the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award of Tsinghua University. You can find further details in my CV.
