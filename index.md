Hello, here is Xiuqiang HE (何秀强). I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich since November 2021, working at the [Automatic Control Laboratory](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/) with [Prof. Florian Dörfler](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/index.html). I received my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Hua Geng](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1094/1517.htm), and my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2016. My research interests include stability issues of future power systems, in particular in modeling, stability analysis, and control of renewable energy resources. I was a recipient of the Beijing Outstanding Graduates Award and the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award of Tsinghua University. You can find further details in my [CV](https://xiuq-he.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

### Research Interests

My research area interfaces power system dynamics, stability, and control, involving multidisciplinary expertise in automatic control, power systems, power electronics, and renewable energy sources. In particular, my research interests include:
- Renewable-rich power system dynamics: stability analysis and control
- Grid-forming control and dynamic ancillary services
- Generic (standardized) modeling of inverter-based generation for power system simulation studies

At current stage, my academic aspiration is to empower the stability and control of future power systems through innovative applications of control theory, bridging the gap in this regard between the fileds of control, power electronics, and power systems.
