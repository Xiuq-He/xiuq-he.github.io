Hello! Here is Xiuqiang HE (何秀强).
I am a senior scientist at ETH Zürich, working at the [Automatic Control Laboratory](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/) with [Prof. Florian Dörfler](https://dorfler.ethz.ch/). From 2021 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich. I received my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Hua Geng](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1094/1517.htm), and my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2016. You can find further details in my [CV](https://xiuq-he.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

### Research Interests

My research area interfaces power system dynamics, stability, control, optimization, and standarization, involving multidisciplinary expertise in automatic control, power systems, power electronics, and renewable energy integration. In particular, my research interests include:
- **Stability:** Modeling, stability analysis, and control of converter-dominated power systems
- **Performance:** Fast frequency and voltage regulation, dynamic virtual power plants, and data-driven control
- **Optimality:** Feedback optimization and game theory in renewable-rich power systems
- **Standardization:** IEC generic modeling of inverter-based generation and next-generation grid codes


### News and Updates

- **November 2024:** Our paper entitled [Cross-Forming Control and Fault Current Limiting for Grid-Forming Inverters](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2024.3500885) is accepted by IEEE TPEL, where we proposed a "cross-forming" (voltage angle forming and current magnitude forming) control concept, a novel perspective for inverter control, different from classical "grid-forming" (voltage magnitude-and-angle forming) and "grid-following" (current magnitude-and-angle forming) paradigms!
